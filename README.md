# Computer-Vision-Projects

In this repository, I'll collect my mini computer vision projects, from basic image augmentation, load data, and building models to some classification, and object detection tasks.

| Projects | Description | Note | key words |
| --       |   ---       | --   | --        |
|timm_transformer_infer | Resize and crop the image, and infer its class by a pretrained transformer model. | Just an inference, no training process. | timm.transformer, resize, basic image preprocessing|
