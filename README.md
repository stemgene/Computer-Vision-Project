# Computer-Vision-Projects

In this repository, I'll collect my mini computer vision projects, from basic image augmentation, load data, and building models to some classification, and object detection tasks.

| Projects | Description | Note | key words |
| --       |   ---       | --   | --        |
|[timm_transformer_infer](https://github.com/stemgene/Computer-Vision-Projects/blob/main/01_timm_transformer_infer.ipynb) | Resize and crop the image, and infer its class by a pretrained transformer model. | Just an inference, no training process. | timm.transformer, resize, basic image preprocessing| 
| [timm transformer infer supplement](https://github.com/stemgene/Computer-Vision-Projects/blob/main/01_supplement_register_forward_hook.ipynb) |Introduce the `layer.register_forward_hook` function | print each layers shape by `layer.register_forward_hook` | `layer.register_forward_hook` |
|[vector and similarity](https://github.com/stemgene/Computer-Vision-Projects/blob/main/02_imger2vec_similarity.ipynb) | Extract the image feature vector with Resnet, then calculate the similarity between images | | Resnet, similarity, image feature vector |
| [OpenCV Image Preprocessing](https://github.com/stemgene/Computer-Vision-Projects/blob/main/OpenCV_ImageProcessing.ipynb) | Preprocee image by OpenCV libraries | | dimension, noise cancel, ROI, Filter, Blur, extract edges |
