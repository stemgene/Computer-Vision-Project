# Computer-Vision-Projects

In this repository, I'll collect my mini computer vision projects, from basic image augmentation, load data, and building models to some classification, and object detection tasks.

| Projects | Description | Note | key words |
| --       |   ---       | --   | --        |
|[timm_transformer_infer](https://github.com/stemgene/Computer-Vision-Projects/blob/main/01_timm_transformer_infer.ipynb) | Resize and crop the image, and infer its class by a pretrained transformer model. | Just an inference, no training process. | timm.transformer, resize, basic image preprocessing| 
|vector and similarity | Extract the image feature vector with Resnet, then calculate the similarity between images | | Resnet, similarity, image feature vector |
